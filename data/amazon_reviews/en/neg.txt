Zipper broke right after return period expired. A nice bag but now useless.

I purchased this for my wife in October, 2017. At the time, we were in the middle of relocating and living in a hotel. I couldn't get this scale to connect to the Wifi in the hotel. I decided to wait until we moved into our home and I could set up my own Wifi system. March 2018- I have set up my Wifi system and this scale still won't connect. Every time I try, I get the error message. Even when I am 10' away from the Wifi unit. I followed the YouTube setup video with no success. When I purchased the unit, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the Wifi router to communicate to the phone. This system is limited to the router connection...which is usually not close to the bedroom unlike a cell phone! I wouldn't recommend this scale to anyone because of the Wifi connection. Instead, please look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication. I am replacing this with a Bluetooth connection scale.

Use at your own risk. My wife and I both had burning sensation and skin reactions. No history of sensitive skin.

Waste of money smfh sooo upset

Did not seem to slow mice down. Plugged them in and mice still kept coming. Did absolutely nothing to stop

First it claims that it has 8 hour battery life. Which it doesn’t. Has never gone longer then 2 1/2 of a hour. Not even that, it does not have any type of noise canceling. Good at phone calls but my main problem with it is that the right one always turns off and both of them are never on at the same time. When they are there on & off. Also the second day they just started making loud noises that wasn’t coming from my phone I have no idea what it was. Save you’re money buy real good quality earbuds these are no good
__________________________
Stupid story line & beyond boring!
__________________________
Horrible packing! Chips were completely crushed!
__________________________
If I could give zero stars I would. I decided to try something new. Usually buy the shin bones. Pup is very soft chewer and She managed to break off a piece ball/joint part and started to choke while chewing it. Bones smells so bad. Just threw all of it away. Like this brand, will only buy shin bones.
__________________________
I put this on my nose as directed twice a day rubbing it in for 2 minutes. The skin on my nose reddened and went completely raw. I was pretty taken aback. I had a well healed scar from falling into barb wire from years ago. Not only did this product not work but I almost ended up at the dermatologist's office, however, putting aqua-for and a bandaid over the area finally calmed it down after about a week. My nose is still reddened however but hoping this goes away soon.
__________________________
The nozzle broke after a week and I reached out to the seller but got no response
__________________________
This stopped working adter a minth. Would not recommend at all.
__________________________
Candy was shipped on a Friday, arrived on Tuesday, and in terrible shape...all melted and gooey. It was sent in some insulated wrapping but still did not survive the heat. Lesson learned. Don't order chocolate in summertime.
__________________________
I mean the case looks cool. I don’t know anything about functionality but they sent me a iPhone 8 Plus case. The title says 6 plus, I ordered a 6 plus and there was no option on selecting another iPhone size beside 6 and 6 plus so I’m very disappointed in the service
__________________________
I ordered a screen for an iPhone 8 Plus, but recevied product that was for a different phone. A significantly smaller phone.
__________________________
Still haven’t received refund.. didn’t fit my 7/8 bar properly flew off on highway
__________________________
I followed the instructions but the chalk goes on gritty and chunky, and looks nothing like the photos. A giant waste.
__________________________
Very poor quality. This broke after one business trip(soft crushable plastic). The digital screen went black and the disc spins but nothing comes out. The sonic quality is also poor although it has EQ options. I miss my old Sony original from 1991. This isn’t even close.
__________________________
bought this to put on my chevy with r12 system but it did not fit
__________________________
Quality was broken after 3rd use. I had a bad experience with this lost voice control.
__________________________
Doesn't cover much of the screen, even with a case on thus doesn't cover the entire touch screen. Also cracked very easily.
__________________________
Not very happy with this product. Upon opening the package I was hit with an unpleasant chemical smell. Had to air it out for a couple of hours before I let my daughter play with it. She's only had it for a total of 3 days and it's already torn at the neck seam. The black of the penguin smudges to the white. Definitely not worth $8.
__________________________
I was very excited about this unit at first. It physically fit what I needed but would not connect to Google pixel 2.
__________________________
Worked until the app updated the scanner and bricked it. Still connects Bluetooth but will not connect to the scanner inside the app.
__________________________
This product is NOT Depends. It is after market. Waste of money.
__________________________
Purchases this for my husband and after 3 months it just stopped working will no longer turn on. Being trying to contact support for this item since it has 1 year warranty but it just seems impossible to heb ahold of someone for a replacement.
__________________________
Not pleased with this external hard drive. I got it bc I don't have any storage space on my phone. I plugged it in to my iPhone and I have to download the app for it....which requires available storage space, which I don't have! It is also doesn't seem to be quality made. Disappointed overall.
__________________________
Ummm.....there is no ink in the cartridges. I'm thinking someone returned this and Amazon regifted it to me. Thanks,
__________________________
These are advertised as “gold” and the picture appears glittery gold but the ones I received are MUSTARD YELLOW! I purchased them jus tin time for a big cupcake order and do not have time to order new replacements. I will now have to shop around locally to find something that actually matches the event theme. Very upset.
__________________________
I love the pillow in the picture but unfortunately, mine does not look like that. The fabric is yellowish, texture looks different and the colors/ink are blotchy and running into the other colors. I uploaded pics but honestly looks worse in person.
__________________________
Absolutely terrible. I ordered these expecting a quality product for 10 dollars. They were shipped in an envelope inside of another envelope all just banging against each other while on their way to me from the seller. 3 of them are broken internally, they make a rattle noise as the ones that work do not. I will be requesting a refund for these and filing a complaint with Amazon. Don't purchase unless you like to buy broken/damaged goods. Completely worthless.
__________________________
Nice style, but quality is too low! It simply fell apart! And I just tried it on, didn't have time to wear
__________________________
Wish I would of read the reviews prior to purchase. This DVD is sadly the worst DVD I have ever purchased. Either here on Amazon or other sites. It plays on my DVD player but the quality is horrible. Also, the first 15-20 minutes or so is just unwatchable. The picture is all scrambled. This is obviously a shoddy bootlegged version from a vhs tape. Amazon really needs to stop selling this!!!
__________________________
If does not always work for some reason.
__________________________
Too stiff, barely zips, and is very bulky
__________________________
My husband uses this for travel/home and it quit charging after a couple months. Sadly, I bought two.
__________________________
Very drying on my hair .
__________________________
This item arrived with several cracks from the packaging. I left on the dashboard of my car and it melted. Worst thing I ever saw.
__________________________
All of the boards came damaged.
__________________________
I received a broken angle plate and i m very upset for the package!!!!!!
__________________________
The product has a Prime badge but after 4 days Amazon said it is running late and I am eligible for a refund. The product did not show up in 5 days and I requested refund. I emailed the seller and he never responded.
__________________________
First of all the package was shoved into my mail box and was basically crushed when I pulled it out. In addition there are deep marks and scrapes that show the wallet was used or pre-owned before getting to me..
__________________________
Had them for like a month, during which time I used them maybe once for 5 minutes. Otherwise kept in the included case. They broke right away. The nosepiece - which is made of a paper-like material glued to a tiny strip of clear plastic - snapped the second time I tried to wear them. Since it's the only thing that holds them up, the glasses essentially became trash after that. Don't waste your time no matter how deep the discount.
__________________________
Too small. Very disappointed.
__________________________
My son was so excited to receive this gift from Santa. He had been asking for it for 3 months. He opened it Christmas day and it was the first toy he played with. It stopped working after two hours. Cheaply made product with a big price tag. Based on the reviews here, the problem seems similar. This product should not be sold for more than $7.00.
__________________________
Does not stay in place, color is very pale!
__________________________
Not what I expected, not satisfied with the product
__________________________
These bags break and have a terrible perfume smell to them. I only got them because I couldn’t get to Costco. Not worth it.
__________________________
It did not work when I received it the packaging was all wet I'm not sure how it got that way but it must have been in transit because it was delivered inside and picked up immediately as we really needed it for our RV. I ordered one from a different supplier and the unit works well but the one I received from Amazon never worked
__________________________
This product came damaged and package arrived open. Very frustrating that this product is unable to be returned while is it still under the 30 day amazon return policy. Very unsatisfied with this purchase.
__________________________
This item is terrible for pregnant woman! Poorly designed! Poor quality! The straps just keep popping off and it’s even big on me. When I adjust it nothing changes. Do not buy.
__________________________
The white is the only one that doesn’t break off so easily . They’re all trash though.
__________________________
Totally got scammed. Worked for 10min. Thanks
__________________________
The glow powder claims to be kiln fired in; that’s a LIE. The glow powder came off onto EVERYTHING in the fish tanks. One betta Fish survived the trauma. The other one died shortly after this chaos.
__________________________
I expect better of Amazon branded products. This cord remains in my car to charge my phone at the end of the day. Purchased in May 2019, dead in August 2019. That seems unreasonable to me.
__________________________
This arrived bent way out of shape to the point where it doesn’t sit flat. No hope of actually using it because the cutting boards just slide out of it, because they sit at an angle.
__________________________
Your going to need all of them and you may get it even after watching the video on YouTube, I do not recommend this product.
__________________________
Initially the product worked as explained. However, after a several months the edges begin to peel up(I also have a case one it), I tried to fix it with no luck. Maybe the peeling comprised the protective material in some way because after the peeling got worse my son dropped my phone, nothing crazy just a normal drop and the phone cracked all down the left edge and ran across the screen and I have otterbox case on it as well. Next time I would buy the glass protector and deal a slightly less responsive screen (as some say happens), seems worth it to me especially now I am stuff with a cracked screen and since that one incident it was knocked out of hand and now theres a huge crack right in the middle.
__________________________
Product was not as described. Foldable metal spoon was missing despite ordering for the 4 pcs Thermos with it
__________________________
Squeaker broke playing catch in the house in less then 3 minutes. $10.00 for a broken rubber ball is a ripoff. NOT HAPPY. Most squeak toys last us months and we still have some from years ago. Not this. Broke immediately.
__________________________
Only worked for two months.
__________________________
I purchased this trimmer because the one I've had for several years just died. I use a trimmer to trim my husband's unruly eyebrows! The first and only time I tried to use this tool, it twisted and pulled the hair out, instead of cutting it. I threw it in the garbage and used my scissors instead. This is a cheap piece of trash!! Don't waste your time and money, choose another brand!! It is truly rated ZERO!
__________________________
Doesn’t look anything like the case.. brought for a gift and I don’t even want to give it to her
__________________________
Although this is a work of fiction, I am troubled that the theology would give someone a very wrong idea of Christianity. I was so worried about leading someone astray that, for the first time in my life, I trashed a book rather than reselling or giving it away. This is fiction, this is fiction, this is fiction.
__________________________
This pillow seemed promising for my beck pain based on the 5 star reviews; however, it was not firm enough for me. After requiring a cervical fusion many years ago my neck needs firm support. If this is you, I would not recommend this pillow.
__________________________
The dragon was missing paint and there was glue or something all over the dragon.
__________________________
One of the leather string fell apart in the first week 😂😂 overall looks awesome
__________________________
Grandchildren did not like them.
__________________________
The picture shows the fuel canister with the mosquito repeller attached so I assumed it would be included. However, when I opened the package I discovered there was no fuel. Since it is not included, the picture should be removed. If someone orders this and expects to use it immediately, like I did, they will be very disappointed.
__________________________
My 10 pound dog shredded the rings within a week of purchasing.
__________________________
Product received was not the product ordered. It was a different set without a kettle and their were ants crawling in and out of the box so i didnt even open it but the picture shows a different item with no kettle. I was sent the same thing as a replacement. Fast shipping though.
__________________________
This phone is not worth it.. the color is washed and the storage is minimal. When I first rcvd the Phone tge charger that came with it did not work so I had to purchase a new charger. Never again will I purchase from third party again. They refused to give me my money back and AMAZON wasn't much help..Sucks
__________________________
Never receive my cases and never answer
__________________________
I wish i could give this a zero. I did nit receive the item and had to order another one from another supplier.
__________________________
Very hard to focus. Could not get clear picture..
__________________________
The rails fit my handguard just fine. Screws are long enough, inserts are the right size, and the rails have the little circular feature to prevent them from moving around. The problem is that none of my accessories fit the rails. It's like they're too narrow. I tried an Atlas bipod with the quick release and it doesn't tighten up. Neither do my Magpul forward grips. Spend a little extra and get quality rails.
__________________________
Received this item today and took my dog for a walk and it snapped in 5 minutes. She wasn’t even pulling. No stars.
__________________________
I know this tracker is several years old and the technology has improved a lot since then, so I was really not expecting much. I just needed a simple step tracker that clips onto my clothing and syncs with my phone, and the price was incredibly low so I figured why not. I received this tracker on Friday, and by Monday it has stopped syncing with my phone. It worked for 2 days. I have tried troubleshooting this error but cannot fix the problem. I don't know if its the app or the tracker, but either way it was a waste. I also felt like it was not counting enough steps when it was working. Fortunately I ended up getting it for free due to a delivery error, but I'm still annoyed that it is such a piece of garbage.
__________________________
I got these things in October and already stop working! I am hoping they will replace them then, I will update my review.
__________________________
My paper towels kept falling off
__________________________
What can I say...I read the reviews. I knew the risks. My son really* wanted a red boombox. The thing stopped working after 2 weeks of playing. I pulled it out the other day because I needed a boombox and low and behold.....it still didn't work. Trust me, avoid this boombox!
__________________________
The unit I received had damaged thread fitting in the middle. I could only fit 1/3 and it won't go all the way in.
__________________________
The product received does not spray and there is no option to notify seller or return. Says sale is final...guess so when you are selling something that is broken!!!!!
__________________________
I was happy with it until I got just past the 30 day return window. Now it won’t charge!!!
__________________________
Product was not to my liking seemed diluted to other brands I have used, will not buy again. Sorry
__________________________
My son was very excited to get this scooter but he has had this scooter for only a month and the handlebar welds and the adjusting bar weld broke as well. Very disappointed. We are unfortunately 3 days over the return policy.
__________________________
FIRE HAZARD DO NOT PURCHASE. Used once as instructed wires melted and caught fire!!!
__________________________
my expectations were low for a cheap scale. they were not met, scale doesnt work. popped the cover off the back to put a battery in and the wires were cut and damaged. wouldn't even turn on. sending it back. product is flimsy and cheap, spend 20 extra bucks on a better brand or scale.
__________________________
The steel rule I received is very inaccurate, I ordered it for accurate markings. I never write negative reviews , but this rule is really bad. I checked against calipers and a rule I know is correct. It does make a fair straight edge.
__________________________
Doesn't distribute the steam strong enough small fan but it is quiet but who cares
__________________________
The clear backing lacks the stickiness to keep the letters adhered until you’re finished weeding! It’s so frustrating to have to keep up with a bunch of letters and pieces that have curled and fell off the paper! It requires additional work to make sure that they’re aligned properly and being applied on the right side, which was an issue for me several times! I purchased 3 packs of this and while it’s okay for larger designs, it sucks for lettering or anything intricate 😏 Possibly it’s old and dried out, but in any event, I will not be buying from this vendor again and suggest that you don’t either!
__________________________
They are the right size, but have no odor control like the Breeze pads That’s important to me with two large cats. I’d rather have the odor control than save the money, as I live in a small apartment,& I don’t enjoy smelling cat pee.
__________________________
description incorrect, only received one book. Cheap packaging, wrapped with some sort of brown paper.
__________________________
The fabric has an awful odor, even after washing. Fabric also had a hole in it. Really liked style, though.
__________________________
I tried everything to get my dogs to use this. Never happened. I would like to return it.
__________________________
I thought this would fill cracks but the material is water thin like paint. It's also very yellow. This product is ineligible for a return so I could not recommend buying it.
__________________________
Came with 2 pens missing from the box.
__________________________
One half stopped working after month of use
__________________________
Poor quality stethoscope. I ad to hold the stethoscope in an awkward position to heard heartbeats. I don't have time for extra hands for that.
__________________________
This product arrived late and no return policy.
__________________________
Unfortunately it didn't help our 2 month old sleep.
__________________________
Upsetting...these only work if you have a thin phone and or no phone case at all. I'm not going to take my phone's case (which isn't thick) off Everytime I want to use the stand. Wast of money. Don't buy if you use a phone case to protect your phone it's too thin.
__________________________
Wrong product was sent
__________________________
The book was hard to keep up with as it jumped around a lot. Also the title doesn’t fit the story. The author indicated several people were infected by this alien, however left out may details on when or how it happened. I was confused at times and had to go back and re read a lot to make sure I didn’t miss anything.
__________________________
not sturdy, can definitely catch your feet.
__________________________
Lots of static. Can barely hear my music
__________________________
The digital reader would not work when I took it out of the box. So now I've wasted quite a bit of money. Tried to contact seller and no response.
__________________________
Very cheaply made, its not worth your money, ours came already broken and looks like it's been played with, retaped, resold.
__________________________
These are very fragile. I have a cat who is a bit rambunctious and sometimes knocks my phone off my nightstand while it's plugged in. He managed to break all of these the first or second time he did that. I'm sure they're fine if you're very careful with them, but if whatever you're charging falls off a table or nightstand while plugged in, these are very likely to stop working quickly.
__________________________
Super poor quality. Rough material. However if this is just used for a photo shoot it is cute.
__________________________
I paid over $50.00 for this to arrive without the battery pack and a broken zipper! When I asked about the battery pack, I was told "they would look to see if they had a spare one." They never followed through. Never would I recommend purchasing from this company!!!! I didn't want to give them even 1 star!
__________________________
They sent HyClean which is NOT for the US market therefore this is deceptive marketing
__________________________
We loved these sheets st first but they have proven to be poor quality with rips at seams and areas of obvious wear from very rare use on our bed. Very disappointed. Would NOT recommend.
__________________________
WE ORDERED THIS, HUNG THE LIGHT AND ONLY 4 OUT OF THE 5 LIGHTS WORKED.
__________________________
I was very unhappy with the delivery - I ordered this on December 11 and was supposed to get this before Christmas since it was a Christmas present for my niece and it did not arrive until after Christmas which was very unfortunate.
__________________________
Worst fucking item I ever bought on Amazon I had a headache for 2 days on this bullshit I thought I had to go to the emergency room please don't but real costumer
__________________________
So far I've only found sports from all over the country. I'll try it again, but that's not what I was looking for.
__________________________
What a rip off. Even cheap tools should work more than one time. Bought this and used it once, it quit working so I returned it to the manufacturer and got a new one, and guess what? Used it one time and the thing quit just like the first one. Cost me $18.00 to return it. I’ll be damned if I pay postage again.
__________________________
One of the boxes I bought of this cereal had live bugs in it. The other 3 were fine.
__________________________
Believe the other reviews, the belt is small and won’t let you start the mower. When you do it will burn the belt in minutes.
__________________________
It is a horrible book.
__________________________
these were nothing like their terrific potato chips from my childhood.
__________________________
The band was clunky and uncomfortable to begin with. I managed to alter it to fit, however it remained awkward and too large. I should have ordered something less masculine. I was managing, though. Until about three weeks in, when the band completely broke. One component of the band apparently simply fell out, and the band fell to pieces. I was disappointed.
__________________________
I did not receive the Fitbit Charge HR that I ordered, I got a Fitbit FLEX ,,, and I am very upset and do NOT like not receiving what I ordered
__________________________
Broke, started to tear immediately when pulling weight
__________________________
The first night of using this air conditioner it stopped working (in the middle of the night) and the red light went on, indicating that the water tank is full. I removed 3 buckets of water (on the 1st night of operation!). After turning it on, AC stopped working in 1 hour again!!! And I removed 1 bucket of water again!!! So going forward, the AC stopped working every single hour. From what I see this AC has a totally faulty water evaporation system. Don't tell me that the company is not aware of it! This AC should be removed from production and sales and faulty system corrected. For $500 I got myself a trash and a headache, instead of peace and calm and comfortable nights what I was hoping for. If you ever think about this crap, you have been warned.
__________________________
DON'T!!! Mine stopped playing 3 days after return deadline ended.
__________________________
We have had this since May 2019, so only 3 months and the timer has stopped working on it and it turns itself off.
__________________________
I own a Pampered Chef small scoop, but am in between residences so most of my 'stuff' is in storage. I love using these scoops while baking for perfectly portioned cookies. I looked at the OXO scoop and the Pampered Chef scoop and decided to save some money and get the OXO one - I usually have good luck with their products. Not this one. At about peanut butter cookie #30 the lever inside the scoop stopped working. I had to pry the handles apart and re-position the lever in order to do a few more, and then repeat. So... save your sanity and buy the Pampered Chef scoop. It's totally worth it!
__________________________
I’m extremely disappointed with this purchase. The amount of pilling on these blankets is unreal. I have blue fuzz all over my house. I’m surprised there is any blanket left. I followed the washing instructions and both times I have washed them they have come out terribly. I would not buy.
__________________________
Had for a week and my kid has already ripped 3 of the 4 while on the cup. So disappointed.
__________________________
Has dairy in it. Not straight coconut milk/cream.
__________________________
I enjoyed using a previous larger version of this humidifier but this model (1) is small and doesn't output much mist or meaningfully change room humidity according to an indoor humidity gauge and (2) produces very loud water gurgling and bubbling sounds that kept me awake. The older version did not have these issues.
__________________________
Very unfortunate that I have to 1 star this screen protector, but the adhesive is terrible. Very good value, but in 15 days I've had to use both that came with as they keep falling off. There are spots in the adhesive that are not coated and allow dust to get under the screen as well.
__________________________
I'm sure I would have liked it, but I never received it. I waited many months and finally went to Bed Bath and Beyond and bought something else. Never could get any help to get my money back either. I rate this a zero.
__________________________
I'm very disappointed to have been notified that my package arrived, and the product is not what I ordered at all. I ordered a hydration pack water backpack and instead received a first aid water proof bag. I order from Amazon all the time and this is the first time this has ever happened, but I was really looking forward to what I ordered.
__________________________
Ordered these for my daughter as a Christmas present. When she opened the case 3 of the markers did not have the caps on and were completely dried out. She was very disappointed. She then starting testing all of them on a piece of paper, several of them began to run out of ink very quickly. Not happy with this product, tried to return, however these markets are an unreturnable item.
__________________________
They sent me 4 of the same flag it’s not like the picture shows
__________________________
Arrived broken! Bulb was fine but didn’t work...disappointing
__________________________
The cords are too short. It stopped working after less than 2 weeks.
__________________________
Stopped working within a year. Would not charge.
__________________________
This company went from five to negative zero stars.
__________________________
Took forever to do 1 nail.
__________________________
They sent me the watch with a dead battery then wanted me to drive it down to ups for a return!
__________________________
We have another puzzle like this we love and were excited to add to ours but this is just circles with the smaller shapes painted on. Not what is looks like, no challenge
__________________________
Installation instructions are vague and pins are cheap. It gets the job done but I dont feel it will last very long. Cheaply made. Update: lasted 3 months and I didn't even put the max weight on a single line.
__________________________
The result was "Invalid", so it's money and blood spent for nothing.
__________________________
Did not work at all. Right from box. Will not charge.
__________________________
Extremely thin backing paper. Poor adhesive. Overall poor quality. Do not waste your money
__________________________
Had this bowl for only 3 months and used it only 6 times when it cracked. I was washing it by hand and heard it crack. This is not a durable product. Perhaps the bowl is too big and makes it weak. I'm going back to glass for my "go to" large Mixing bowl- not fancy but durable!
__________________________
This movie took to long to get to the point. A lot of nothing happens for an hour, by that time I was bored.
__________________________
Does not work. Not supported by device pops up.
__________________________
This is definitely a fake.
__________________________
I ordered this Instant Pot Pressure Cookbook when it was on sale through Amazon. There is poor editing throughout this recipe book. Many recipes have missing steps and ingredients. There is no index, only a table of contents that is difficult to use. Even the table of contents is not alphabetized so you have to read down the entire list to find a recipe. The author assumes you already know how to use the Instant Pot. There are no reminders regarding sealing the Instant Pot lid or any other safety instructions. These instructions would have been helpful to those of us who are new to the Instant Pot.
__________________________
Did not order; returned
__________________________
The package arrived in the town just down the road from me, and they are holding it for 3 more days for reasons unknown, when I could have picked it up from there myself and had it yesterday, it's so annoying
__________________________
We bought this for light rain for our kids birthday party and it collapsed! Luckily no one was hurt! Then seller wanted me to return the 100lb product and somehow get bent poles in a box and I would have to pay for the return shipping!!!
__________________________
this started out to be a great knife for being out on the water ... until it went into the water ... it began to rust right away; wow, what a disappointment and waist of money ... if wanting something to be used while in the water that will not rust as soon as it touches the water, then look elsewhere
__________________________
KIDS NEVER PLAYED WITH THEM AND THEY DO NOT KEEP A CHARGE!
__________________________
The Product arrived broken. Amazon immediately put me in touch with CPO the sellers. CPO said they will not honor the Amazon product return refund policy without pictures of the item sent prior to the item being returned. Beware do not buy from this third party vendor.
__________________________
Unfortunately never received product
__________________________
Larger than expected. Not as pretty as I had hoped.
__________________________
Had Western Digital in all my builds and they've been great. Decided to try the Fire Cuda and it failed two weeks in and I lost so much data. Never again!!
__________________________
Don't waste your money, much too thin to protect your phone
__________________________
DO NOT BUY! Device did not work after the first use and the company is ignoring my return request. You want the device to be reliable when you need it. I no longer trust this brand.
__________________________
Both top corners cracked and one of the corners actually chipped/fell off. I had used the case for three months.
__________________________
One of them worked, the other one didn't. There's no apparent damage, it just won't work on multiple phones and with multiple wall ports.
__________________________
Item was used/damaged when I received it. Seal on the box was broken so I checked everything before install and it looks like the power/data connections are burnt. Returning immediately.
__________________________
The bottle leaked in the package never got to use it
__________________________
Guess i picked the wrong flavor. Sunflower seed is disgusting. I’ll be tossing them after eating a few out one bag.
__________________________
This product did not work as advertised in fact it was supposed to help keep my water clean but it did the opposite very disappointed
__________________________
The parts did not fit together well. It clogged up and stopped working in less than 24 hours. I returned it.

Item arrived barely not expired on bottle....smell and taste like SHIT! not like watermelon mint for damn sure. ive had a million protein shakes and this is by far the worst. i dont even think it tastes the way it initially did when it came in fresh out the assembly. Last but not least was the only product that didnt allow me to return the item although i was able to return other products from this seller. Long story short the seller had to of know this was garbage and blocked the acceptance of returns so i had to call amazon to get this resolved. you get 1 start
__________________________
This was not what I thought...patches are very hard, not flexible..uncomfortable to wear...heat impact was too warm.....well packaged...
__________________________
wast of money fake did one launch broke a immediately.
__________________________
Bought it on December broke on me on February. Got an E1 error meaning hardware fault. Second time I bought this only to break a couple months later. Buyer beware.
__________________________
WARNING!!! Will make your fur babies sick! After 400 dollar vet bill the diagnosis is this.
__________________________
This product is very small. The pictures are very deceptive and although I haven’t used them yet, I’m beginning to think this was a rip off because the price should be less due to the very small size of these. They’re only as wide as my pinky finger and as long as my index finger.
__________________________
I did not receive this item with my other items that were all in the same box
__________________________
my problem with the product is the fit. I have a large head and it is too tight everywhere and the neck just doesnt feel right. I want to pull it down but then my nose has no room. I can't use it because of the poor fit.
__________________________
This rice is from the ice age. It tastes ghastly and revolting. I threw the rest away and I'm sure not even the ants will like it. It seems to be leftovers from Neanderthals which might add some archeological value to it.
__________________________
Pillow do not look like picture
__________________________
The adhesive is only on the edge of the screen, and did not stick in one of the corners. This makes it so my finger can't make contact with the screen, so basically I can't use that corner of my screen. There are also visible lines where the curve is in the screen protector. Just overall a poorly designed product. Don't waste your money on this one.
__________________________
It leaves white residue all over dishes! Gross!
__________________________
I opened a bottle of this smart water and took a large drink, it had a very strong disgusting taste (swamp water). I looked into the bottle and found many small particles were floating in the water... a few brown specs and some translucent white. I am completely freaked out and have contacted Coca-Cola, the product manufacture.
__________________________
1/3 of the bags came broken
__________________________
It doesn’t stick to my car and it’s to big
__________________________
My package arrived with nothing in it?! My cord that I use for my phone is broken and I was really depending on this replacement. I will give a better rating when I have something to rate!!
__________________________
Shocked when I opened the box to find that the tool was broken, most of the attachments were completely used up or broken. This thing looked like it had been used for years, then put back into the box, sawdust and all then shipped to me. Check out the pictures! I'm sure it's a great tool, but I'll never know...
__________________________
Not squirrel proof AT ALL. In fact, the squirrels get more mileage out of this thing than the birds do.
__________________________
It already stopped working. It no longer charges.
__________________________
Not enough room for your coffee cup. Not big enough for a cell phone. Not the best material I would not recommend the bag it's not good.
__________________________
These literally fell apart the first time they were used. The triggers broke the first time one of them was used. Terrible quality--save your money.
__________________________
My hubs is just dealing with it but hates it. The side leather trim started peeling one day after use. Pretty disappointing.
__________________________
never stayed connected to wifi. Unusable
__________________________
ordered and never received it.
__________________________
When we received the scoreboard it was broken. We called for support and left our number for a call back. 3 days later no call. Terrible service!
__________________________
This product seems worthless for me. I don’t think they work for anything. I am sorry I bought them.
__________________________
Not worth it. Looks like a cartoon Jean painted on leggings.
__________________________
I bought this from Liberty Imports and it was not secured in the packaging and did not work. I returned it for another one and with the same result. The second one had markings on the car that suggest it was used before.
__________________________
I did not purchase this item and why was the money drafted out of my account
__________________________
One of the 5 cords received is already broken. The other 4 have hardly been used. The one that’s broken has only been used moderately and it already stopped charging.
__________________________
Wrong color suspension and quality compared to picture. Picture shows different suspension, color. Very disappointed.
__________________________
I didn’t even want to give this 1 star! This is a piece of JUNK! Terrible made! I am having. Such a HARD TIME RETURNING THIS PRODUCT! Don’t WASTE YOUR MONEY. It looks like these toys were made for a doll house. Wrongly advertised!
__________________________
it does not work, only one hearing aid works at a time
__________________________
Some of the undies fit wonderful but other pairs are much smaller. Waste of money!
__________________________
Super awesome light My 5 year old absolutely loved this light It didn’t last long he got it for his birthday in January it’s February already has trouble with the buttons and doesn’t run bright with plug in eats up batteries even tried recharging batteries Super cool but needs improvement
__________________________
STOP! Turn around! These are a SCAM! These JUMBO Bully Sticks aren't even as wide as a PIN!!
__________________________
When you order a product, you expect the product to be as described. They were advertised as CAP Dumbbells. However, the product received was Golds Gym dumbbells. If I wanted Golds Gym, I would have bought these from Walmart. I have a complete set of CAP dumbbells, with the exception of my one set from Golds Gym. Is the weight correct, yes. Due they perform, yes. I just expect to get what I paid for not something else. After reading a few other reviews, I see that others have had the same issue.
__________________________
I have not yet got my order!!!
__________________________
Hard to read and the colors are too bright.
__________________________
The description of this product indicated that it would have a cosmetic flaw only. This pendant is missing the socket. There is no place to put the light bulb.
__________________________
Feels very light and cheaply made FM radio did not even work...very unhappy with my purchase and do not recommend buying this one!!!!
__________________________
The version I received does not have any illustrations at all. I was mistaken by looking at some of other reviews that had photos of the book showing pictures.
__________________________
The water didn't get very hot and ran through quickly, making a weak cup of coffee. After having it a little more than a month, only half of the water would go through, basically making a mini cup of weak coffee. Amazon said we had it more than a month so we would have to contact the company. The company said it was still under warrantee but we would have to pay $11 shipping and handling to get a new one. $11 is a lot of money considering we don't know if the second one will break after a short time. So now we have a $40 piece of garbage and will be replacing it with a different brand. Very dissatisfied!
__________________________
This charger started to fall apart after only 3 months. The back continually falls off and the cord wires are exposed. I would have expected a longer life on this charger. Poor quality. I'm sure I'll have to replace it. Description says 24 month warranty, however Warranty expired 3 months after purchase. I do not recommend.
__________________________
Out of the box mine leaked all over. Poor quality.
__________________________
The tablet had a slow reaction time. I would touch the screen and the page or item would take at least 2 to 3 seconds to work.
__________________________
We ordered 4 diff brands so we could compare and try them out and this one was by far the worst, once you sat down. You felt squished. I’m 5.5 and 120 lbs. My husband could barely fit.
__________________________
So pretty...but the first time I unplugged it, the glass top came off of the base. There’s a plastic ring attached to the bottom of the glass part. It has notches - supposedly to allow you to twist it onto the nightlight base. You’d need to be able to do that in order to replace the bulb. I’ll try gorilla glue or something to see if the ring can be securely affixed to the glass. Surprisingly poor design for something so beautiful.
__________________________
Says it's charging but actually drains battery. Do not buy not worth the money.
__________________________
I loved the first book so much had to read the sequel. Actually couldn't believe it was even better than the first
__________________________
cheap and waste of money
__________________________
Added so much to the projects! Works well.
__________________________
the packaging was so bad the box fell apart and crushed other smaller packages
__________________________
Made very cheap!!!! you get what you pay for
__________________________
Two of the glasses were broken when I opened the package. Could you please be careful for packaging glass items.
__________________________
Plates won’t snap in. The keep falling out no master how hard you push. Leaks every where. Handle won’t snap shut. It’s good difficult to use. It’s not like my d sandwich maker I used in college. Only reason I wanted another one-the simple ease of making sandwiches. But this is more headache than worth it. I’m cleaning the mess it’s made.
__________________________
My dog ,a super hyper Yorkie, wouldn't eat these. Didn't like the smell of them and probably didn't like the taste. I did manage to get them down him for 3 days to see if it would help him . The process of getting them down him was traumatic for him and me. They did not seem to have any effect on him one way or another , other than the fact that he didn't like them and didn't want to eat them. I ended up throwing them away. Money down the drain. Sorry, I can't recommend them.
__________________________
Please be very careful.... This wax gets extremely hot. It blistered my face in 4 different spots..
__________________________
I was so happy I finally found venison and elk sausage well what a disappointment. Save your money they all taste the same and it is not a lot of taste either would not even pay 2 dollars each for these
__________________________
Nothing is worse than getting a toy for a child and having it not work. This toy did not talk and left my 3 1/2 year old grandson upset. Waste of money.
__________________________
Won’t pull dents out, once pressure is applied, the tool just pops off. Glue that does stick to the car is a pain to get off, will even pull off paint. This this is worthless.
__________________________
Warped. Does not sit flat on desk.
__________________________
Not the best product for the money
__________________________
Received this today and it doesn’t fit my .40 clip very disappointing!!
__________________________
I order hot pink. Look at that. That's red. But label is hot pink No return? Omg!!!!!
__________________________
Came with one detent ball broken
__________________________
Material looks and feels very cheap.
__________________________
Worst product I’ve bought
__________________________
Tried these out and did not charge our X phone nor my daughters iPhone 8
__________________________
The color is mislabeled. This is supposed to be brown/blonde but comes out almost white. Completely unusable.
__________________________
They are all smashed. I have pictures. They look melted and all smashed.
__________________________
We return the batteries and never revive a refund
__________________________
I won’t order this you will be wasting your time money and energy
__________________________
Im not sure if its just this sellers stock of this product or what but the first order was no good, each bottle had mold and clumps in the bottle and usually companies will put a couple of metal beads in a bottle to aid in the mixing but these had a rock in it... like a rock off the ground. I decided to replace the item, same seller, and once again they were all clumpy and gross... I attached a photo. I wouldnt buy these, at least not from this seller.
__________________________
Very disappointed in the quality, patterns and size I will donate or give away. Very unhappy.
__________________________
Uneven base plates cause the pipes to be not plumb. 1/2" pipe is good though, however, I needed 1" or > for my 4" thick wood cookie table.
__________________________
Pure sugar Do not buy this brand
__________________________
Not even good, this screen protector was a joke; the lgv30 have a screen curve around the side and this not even cover it. It peel of easily. Wasted.
__________________________
This shirt is not long as the picture indicates. It's just below waist length. Disappointed b/c I am 5'10 and wanted to wear with leggings.
__________________________
This product was defective and didn’t work. I contacted the seller who finally sent a return label and sent it back. This was three weeks ago and I still haven’t received a replacement nor a refund.
__________________________
It said that was shipped but I didn't get anything
__________________________
they changed the recipe and now they are dry and crumbly
__________________________
The figure is pretty solid, but the legs were very weak on mine. Both knee joints have become stuck to the point where if I try to bend them, the lower part of the legs will just break off. Overall, the figure has great detail. My figure just has very weak knee joints.
__________________________
Love the look of them but only had them for 3 months an one of the lights burned out:/
__________________________
Most worthless attempt at saving money I have ever encountered. Three of the exhaust runners either hit or miss-align the intake manifold. It took me more that 15 hours to cut and modify the runners to a point where they had an 1/8 of an inch clearance to the intake. Niw that I have everything assembled, and without touching the down pipe connections, now the downpipe is over a half inch off. To make matters worse, the connecting joint is almost too big for the flares on the downpipe and to top it all of, the supplied hardware is almost am inch and a half too short.
__________________________
Cheap halogen bulbs that do not come in individual packages. 1 blew out after a day - you get what you pay for! Would not recommend.
__________________________
These are not soft or flexible on the ear at all! Worried I will damage my ear using them and they don't work to massage the ear as it says either!
__________________________
Bought it over a month ago and it never came in.
__________________________
This dress is trash! Not even worthy of a house dress. Literally just pieces of material sewn together. Absolutely no workmanship or quality about it! DO NOT BUY!!!!
__________________________
This paper I believe is a replacement for a glossy cannon paper I used to buy. This paper isn't as heavy as the previous edition and won't stay straight in my Canon pro-100 printer.
__________________________
I had these desk top fan since Christmas 2017 and only used them a hand full of times and now the fans don’t even work. What a waste of money.
__________________________
Arrived busted in 2 corners and the box was ripped, looked like they were reselling a returned product.
__________________________
Bought this iPhone for my 9.7” 6th generation iPad as advertised. Not only did this take over 30 minutes just try to put it on, but it also doesn’t fit whatsoever. When we did get it on, it just bent right off the sides, exposing the entire edges of all the parts of the iPad. This is the worst piece of garbage I have bought from Amazon in years, save your money and go somewhere else!!
__________________________
The product suppose to come with the leash Leash is missing
__________________________
This review is not for the product its for the seller. There was a mistake on there part and I didn't receive the right product . Would have been too much of a hassle for me to return. Gave the tablet form vitamins to a friend. This product does work.
__________________________
broke the first time I used it.
__________________________
Belt loops were not fastened upon opening. They were not stitched.
__________________________
Horrible all around. My girlfriend got one for herself and it works great. I got one for my mother’s room thinking it would help her sleep and it never worked
__________________________
Doesn’t even work . Did nothing for me :(
__________________________
Didn’t work for me. Did not fit.
__________________________
When I first saw this I thought it was beautiful, BUT it smelled SO BAD. At first I thought it was the smell of leather, but many pointed out that is was a MOLD smell. It never went away, so I had to return it. PLUS, the pockets for the credit cards are too big. The credit cards slide all the way down, the tips don't show so you have no idea what card is where and very difficult to get out. THE PHOTO THEY SHOW WHERE THE CARDS ARE STICKING OUT IS INACCURATE.
__________________________
Yeah, that's about it. The nipple pieces are so tiny that at best, they are fit for feeding baby mice or maybe baby gerbils. I can't use them for my two little, five week old puppies. They weigh 1.3 and 1.5 pounds respectively, and this teensy nipple is too small that they would even recognize this as something from which to suckle. Other use I can think of for these would be a 5 - 10 year old girl, who wants to bottle feed her dolls. She would love these! I can't imagine how the makers can claim that all professional nurses use them for new born animals. I don't believe it! I am going to buy some real baby bottles with some real nipples.
__________________________
This door hanger is cute and all but its a bit small. My main complain is that, i cannot close my door because the bar latched to the door isnt flat enough.. Worst nightmare.
__________________________
Zero stars!!!! Scam company DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!!!
__________________________
Cheaply made. It broke during first use and it is not easily returnable.
__________________________
Absolute junk!I used it and broke withing 20 seconds,keep scrolling on this one,I give it zero stars.Poorly built,UNREAL that they actually built this thing to sell it,it should come free as an incentive to buy a 20 dollar drill.Better off using it as a handle to carry your drill,then again,it would prolly pop out of the drill from the 5 pounds of weight.
__________________________
It does not work and it smells really bad
__________________________
Bought this gauge half way worked. It would freeze and then drop real fast. I turned key off and back on and it would show different readings. The sender was good. I bought a sierra and works like a charm.
__________________________
Got a screen didn’t worked reorder it and still didn’t work trash screen
__________________________
At first I loved it because it looked good and was light weight. However, the magnet stuck to everything that my arm came in contact with and pulled my fit bit off, such as the refrigerator door, my office building door, the car door, etc. I have had my fitbit for over 3 years with the original band but after having the new bracelet a month, I lost it last week when it fell off somewhere between my office and th e restaurant I walked to for lunch. Very very disappointed! Now I am, out the money for the bracelet and I have to buy another fitbit.
__________________________
First order delivered was missing; ordered another one and was double charged. Product is thin and pages are even thinner. Disappointing on multiple levels.
__________________________
It charged, but fell apart pretty quickly. I bought this after I lost my Garmin charger. I got about 4 uses out of this charger when the USB port completely fell out of the charger. Luckily, I found my old one.
__________________________
Tip broke after a few weeks of use.
__________________________
Product doest work at all anymore.
__________________________
Does not fit average tv
__________________________
A lot of the capsules were empty, dust everywhere.
__________________________
The first 2 days it lit up nicely. Then it just became very dim and doesn’t light up very much. Waste of money
__________________________
Please do not buy this! I was so excited and I got one for me and my co worker because we freeze in our offices. It's so small and barely even heats up. One of them didn't even work at all!
__________________________
Couldn't take it anymore - had to throw out the hot smelly box before it stunk up the garage. Fellow Amazons - YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! THE BAGS SMELL LIKE CIG's!!!!!!!!
__________________________
When i opened the package 2 of them were broken. Very disappointing
__________________________
Out of 4 pairs, 2 of the pairs were low quality sound. One of the 2 had lower volume in the left ear. The other pair was just awful sound. The other 2 were higher quality, but what you'd expect for the price. Unfortunately, I have to return all 4 if I want to get any of my money back for the 2 broken ones. That really stinks.

Don't buy this game the physics are terrible and I am so mad at this game because probably there are about 40 hackers on every single game and the game. Don't doesn't even do anything about it you know they just let the hackers do whatever they want and then they do know that the game is terrible but they're doing absolutely nothing about it and the game keeps on doing updates about their characters really what they should be updating is the physics because it's terrible don't buy this game the physics are terrible and mechanics are terrible the people that obviously the people that built this game was high or something because it's one of the worst games I've honestly ever played in my life I would rather play Pixel Games in this crap it's one of the worst games don't buy
__________________________
Bought this light January 19, 2018, the topmost light broke within warranty and vendor replaced quickly enough. Second light same issue, yesterday the top most light broke (again) and now out of warranty window. I now own two lights and neither work - DO NOT BUY
__________________________
It broke after a couple of days used in the water
__________________________
There are terrible! One sock is shorter and tighter than the other. The colors look faded when you put them on. These suck
__________________________
What I received with this product was a fancy bottle of BROWN WATER that had a extremely slight scent of vanilla and NO VANILLA TASTE! It tastes like plain water. I tried working with the company as well as Amazon and the company REFUSED to allow a return of this disgraceful excuse for vanilla extract. I would not recommend Blue Cattle Truck in the future for any product. This is absolutely ridiculous that a company would not stand behind its product. So, now I have a $36 bottle of brown water to stand on a shelf and remind me that I was taken advantage of. I would rate the product a "0" but it won't allow anything less than one. Thanks a lot, Blue Cattle Truck.
__________________________
We bought one of these. Returned it, bought another. Stupid mistake. I don’t know if we had bad batteries but we ordered two of these. They last a couple of hours and die. Not worth the money, to put new batteries in every couple hours. Not the headache now of taking the tape off the walls. Ugh.
__________________________
The teapot came with many visible scratches on it. After repeated efforts to contact the seller, they have simply ignored requests to replace or refund money.
__________________________
ordered January 24th, officially opened the box last week (end of March) and it stopped working after second use. Apparently no returns after 30 days. Screwed consumer
__________________________
There is a very strong, offensive odor on the inside!!
__________________________
I give this product zero stars. The bottle appears very old as if it has been sitting on a shelf in the sun. The expiration date is May 2020.
__________________________
We had this in shower area where it only got moisture, no direct water. First the suction kept failing. Then the alarm mysteriously kept going off. Replaced batteries, No improvement. Couldn't turn it off or reset it. Garbage.
__________________________
Very disappointed! As soon as we ordered the paid version, it stopped working. We couldn’t sing any songs at all. The free version was better than the one we paid for! The whole app stopped working when we clicked “buy”.
__________________________
I wanted to switch from supermarket "natural" kibble to 100% organic, but my cat hates this stuff. It costed a lot, so I'm very disappointed.
__________________________
The box arrived crashed and opened.
__________________________
It wasn't the size in the picture never again going to buy this product
__________________________
This screen protector was horrible. Thin, came with no tools, and air bubbles for days. Worthless.
__________________________
The directions make no sense, could not even put it together as all of the parts did not come with it either
__________________________
I have a pair of these gloves from over 10 years ago. That pair is great, you can take a razor sharp knife and run in along the palm and nothing, no cuts, to tears.. Nothing. The new ones are garbage. I took the same knife and lightly ran it across the palm and it cut all the way through the glove. You can tell they are no longer made the same. Save your money and if you bought these DO NOT TRUST them. they offer NO cut resistance at all.
__________________________
Not reliable and did not chop well. Came apart with second use. Pampered Chef is my all-time favorite with Zyliss coming in second.
__________________________
Well, the mother card came damaged and I can not return it because I'm from another country and the cost of sending the package is greater than the price of the card, so it's not worth it. The card is beautiful and comes well packaged, but unfortunately it came damaged from the factory, it does not turn on or the LED lights that it has on the part of the external connectors. The criticism is for those people who buy the items internationally, bear in mind that they can lose their money if it is damaged and the cost of returning it to amazon is much higher than the price of the item.
__________________________
I did not receive my package yet The person Noel B is not living here I don't know Him Please take a picture of the person you giving the package thank you
__________________________
Clumpy, creases on my lips, patchy, all in all not worth it. Have to scrub my lips nearly off with makeup remover to get it all off.
__________________________
Item did not fit my car properly.
__________________________
Just had the second one break in the last 3 months. The clip on back of the case for the belt is simply not sturdy enough and it's broken in the exact same place every time.
__________________________
Product broke in less that 3 months!! The speakers are great but the manufacturing not so great !
__________________________
I REALLY wanted to love this protein powder, but it gave me terrible gas and the flavor wasn't very good. I tried using it to make chia pudding as well and it came out very bitter.
__________________________
I have not received my order yet!!!!! Please contact me as to where it is!!!!
__________________________
Definitely not what I expected! Now to say this I usually use the Doc Johnson Seven Wonders vibrator which is awesome I think they stop making it so I had to find an alternative so I found this one the price was decent read the reviews you know looked at everybody else reviews and base it off of that so hey I ordered okay so I had it for a few weeks now wanted to give an honest review and honestly... I hate it I think it's more or less the design of the applicator I don't really like the fatness of it I really like to sleep slim ones that to me they really stimulate your clit a whole lot better but hey that's just my opinion I went by it again that we looking for alternative hope this helps anybody on the quest to find a good bullet LOL LOL
__________________________
Only 6 of the 12 lights were included...
__________________________
I try to turn it on, it won’t work so , it returned.
__________________________
Arrived for the second time broken.
__________________________
I have never received coffee from Amazon that was punctured and there’s no support for this product!
__________________________
This watch was purchased in mid-June. Not even 2 months later it's losing 45 minutes every 4 hours. The indicator boasts a "full charge" but still, losing >10 minutes every hour - faulty. Amazon's customer service was A COMPLETE JOKE. I was on the line for over ten minutes (probably longer but my watch runs slow), and got nowhere. Out of warranty.
__________________________
So after finally sitting down to print some documents I found that the cartridge has bands in it. tried walking through all the instructions on cleaning it however if a state that if it doesn't work then more than likely that cartridge needs to be replaced. So it was a waste of $100 on this ink. I WONT be buying from this seller ever again
__________________________
Never received item and smile amazon has no way on their website to refund orders that were never received.
__________________________
What a piece of shit ! Very disappointed
__________________________
Amazon never deliver the items. Horrible customer service. Considering new purchase choices.
__________________________
Only a couple weeks after mounting using the included adhesive, the mount gave out and dropped my Rift ruining the display. The included adhesive is not strong enough, and while I planned to mount using the included screws in the near future, I figured the adhesive would hold until my room was ready for the permanent mount. It was not and gave out in the middle of the night. Very frustrated right now and I wouldn't complain if no adhesive was included but instead an adhesive too weak for the job is, making it too easy for this to happen.
__________________________
Well, I ordered the 100 pack and what came in the mail was silver eyeshadow....Yep, silver women’s eyeshadow...no blades....how does that happen???
__________________________
Almost all of the packages were hard to chew so I didn't bother opening the rest :(
__________________________
I opened my package to discover it had opened and spilled everywhere! I went to return the item as defective and found out it isn’t returnable. Now I have 3 lbs of gum balls I have to throw out because I have no idea on how sanitary the boxes are and where they have been.
__________________________
This review is for Amazon directly rather than the product. The mailbox was damaged when arrived. The delivery box was fine, but the product packaging and the mailbox itself was damaged inside. Clearly someone at amazon fulfillment dropped the ball. Reordered. Return was easy.
__________________________
The graphics were not centered and placed more towards the handle than what the Amazon image shows. Only the person drinking can see the graphics. I will be returning the item.
__________________________
I did not receive this order. Tracking said that it was delivered on 6/6 and signed for by Rose. There is NO Rose at this location. I WANT THIS ITEM!!
__________________________
Crap! Totally not worth a penny.
__________________________
I recieved a totally different product than I ordered (pictured) and I see that I cannot return it !?! I give them one star just because I'm tryin to be nice. I ordered these black hats for a christmas project that I am doin with my 5 yr old son for his classroom and now I'm afraid to even try to reorder them again in fear that I'll recieve another different product.
__________________________
Seal was already broken when I opened the container and it looked like someone had used it.
__________________________
all of the cards are from cheap paper
__________________________
Weak/cheap quality! The bristles are not full and very flimsy...doesn’t clean the sides well. I love the nipple cleaner.
__________________________
Was really looking forward to this product due to the reviews but when the package arrived, the jar was in pieces and marmalade was everywhere. They didn’t even put the product in a box; just the standard amazon shipping package. Disappointed
__________________________
It wasn't what I thought it was so I sent it back , for someone that ordered the right thing the process was perfect
__________________________
After having the trampoline for only a couple months, our trampoline got a good size tear in it.
__________________________
I bought this because I teach Geometry and the one that the school gives us is not accurate enough and opens easily and I thought This would be better. I was Wrong. The lead constantly pushes through anytime I try And use it. It is very frustrating and the compass is useless.
__________________________
Not as described. The large sphere is 2in not 20 like advertised.

received 2 sets only have 5 each screwdriver per set !!!!!!??????

This would be an awesome blender if the lid were made worth a dang. It's a high enough powered little blender but the lid is so cheaply made that I literally have to keep a hand towel near by to hold the lid on with and it still gets saturated. The first time we used it my 3 year old wanted to help and ended up having hot coffee sprayed all over his hands and arms.

It was easy to put together and I was excited for this night stand but the drawers I believed are defective. The top part is flush; however they don’t close all the way on the bottom.
__________________________
Finger print scanned does not work with it on
__________________________
Wrong item shipped. Ask for connectors and got a box of fuses!!! What a waste of my time waiting for this to arrive.
__________________________
Ordered this for a Santa present and Christmas Eve noticed it came broken!
__________________________
terrible quality. cheaply made and looks kitschy! I have wanted to return it from the get-go but they charge for shipping. I have it!
__________________________
Sizing runs really small. Order a size or two up. Also really poor quality. Not worth your money.
__________________________
No longer connects to wifi and supplier no help
__________________________
I don't like anything about it and I don't like that it is not able to be returned. JUNK!
__________________________
I love the cologne of it ever is actually delivered. They said it arrived 2 weeks ago and that I have to pick it up? Then what is the point of using Amazon is I still have to go pick it up. Amazon you are slipping so bad lately!
__________________________
I got this backpack Monday night and I was excited about it because I had seen many great reviews for it. I used it for the first time the next day to hold a fair amount of things, and while I was out I noticed this huge rip right down the middle that wasn't there before. I would have been more understanding if I had it for a few months but this was the first time I had put anything into it. I've never been more disappointed in a product before as I have with this backpack. Be very careful when considering purchasing this product.
__________________________
Sorry but these are a waist of money. Washed my handy one time and they come right off. I even glued them on because they were so cheep and didn’t stay when you put the ring on .
__________________________
tried it for 3 weeks every day and it did absolutely nothing for my nails
__________________________
Does not work as described.
__________________________
Smell terrible and neck is coming apart sent back
__________________________
You will have Lopsided cheeks if you don’t adjust the pads each time you pull them up after using the bathroom. The lace rises and buckles causing bulges through your pants.
__________________________
Did not fit very well
__________________________
I got this less then a week ago. It doesn’t work. When I went to return it I saw that they don’t accept returns or apply refunds for defective merchandise.
__________________________
It’s disappointing opening the box getting excited to see your package arrive, only to find that only 4 sets were delivered not the 6 you were promised.
__________________________
Had three weeks and corner grommet ripped out
__________________________
haven't used it yet i got it for my son to use
__________________________
Failed out of the box.
__________________________
Cheap knock off that came with rust on it. Sent it right back.
__________________________
I bought the tie-dyed version and it was SO comfortable. Stretchy breathable material. I decided to buy the black version for work. Bad decision! The material is completely different. It doesn’t stretch, it’s not breathable and it is very small and uncomfortable! It even seems it’s stitched differently so that it coveres 50% less of my head. So disappointing!!
__________________________
They did nothing what the description said. I wore them not even 10 minutes and the began to fog up.
__________________________
I wouldn't know because it says that my item was delivered, but it is not here.
__________________________
Got the cutoff in and had it break cutting off an aluminum part. I highly recommend against it
__________________________
This thing is angled the wrong way. It makes you bend your wrist up in an unnatural position which is very fatiguing. Sent it back after using for less than an hour.
__________________________
I bought this as a tracker to use while I swim, and I didn't even get a proper chance to try it. First off, it's not water resistant and it is not recommended to use while swimming per the instruction manual. Second, it doesn't come with a charger. Instead, it suggests to use a USB plug or computer. Fine, we have lots of those around. When I try to get it into the port to charge it, however, it launches right back out. I'm not sure if there's something not compatible or if this is just poorly made, but I'm not going to sit and hold my device in while it charges. Lastly, the app keeps popping up ads, even when it's closed. Ads popped up while I was sending a text, which is very concerning. I then closed down all active apps on my phone, and saw yet another ad when I went to check the time 20 minutes later. Horrible product, I guess I get what I paid for...
__________________________
The screen protector doesn't stick to the screen. Followed the directions , the first one didn't really stick on the top just wouldn't stay ,had rainbow effect, this phone is new, the second one lasted three days before popping loose on top, the screen cleaner wipes that came with wet dried out for the second one, so used my lens cleaner, how do you get them to stick, this is the second time that I have contacted about this.
__________________________
I bought the surprise shirt for grandparents, but was sent one for an aunt. I was planning on surprising them with this shirt tomorrow in a cute way, but now I have to postpone the get together until I receive the correct item sent hopefully right this time.
__________________________
We bought this for the size and comfort after my husbands knee replacement surgery. On the 3rd day of using it, there is a scorched/burned out spot in the center of the pad! Terrifying that it almost caught on fire!! Don’t know how to go about reporting this...
__________________________
I was so excited about this and wanted to like it so much. My dog (who is not a strong chewer AT ALL) destroyed it in under 5 minutes :/ $11 down the drain for NOTHING. Great concept, extremely poor execution unfortunately.
__________________________
Very poor material brooke in two days. Not worthy. What a waste and my daughter was looking forward to that.
__________________________
This strap is very loose fitting, defeats the purpose...no matter how tight I pull it...it does not work and I hv a sizable head...don't t like it..waste of $$$...sending it back...
__________________________
This is a poorly made piece that was falling apart as we assembled it - some of the elements looked closer to cardboard than any wood you can imagine. I can foresee that it will be donated or thrown away in the next few months or even weeks.
__________________________
Soooo disappointed. The images look as though they are a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy to the point where they are so distorted and there is nothing to even color! You'd be better off making your own!
__________________________
These are beautiful glasses. We ordered them specifically to drink gin drinks. They are the perfect size and look really classy. We used them a couple of times and hand washed them each time. The third time I hand washed them and the bowl part of one of them totally shattered in my hand while I was drying it. I was really careful with them but still this happened. Such a shame. Really liked them until that happened. I was going to order more but I'm nervous the same thing will happen again.
__________________________
Total waste of money. None worked. I try to inflate myself and the balloon immediately deflated so I went to a local balloon store and paid the owner blow up the others I bought the balloon still didn’t inflate...:( I totally do not recommend buying this product waste of money
__________________________
Returned item. Wouldn’t work on my faucet
__________________________
Purchased in June but not worn till school started in August. Both shoes are falling apart at the toe. This is my 5th pair of Sketchers boots, at least 2nd pair of this style. I wear them daily and typically they let an entire school year. Very disappointing.
__________________________
Ordered 4 boxes to stock for staff at work. They all came looking like they got ran over by a truck. They used the worst packing available.
__________________________
Huge disappointment box was all messed up and toy was broken
__________________________
Not wanting to give it any stars, I gave it 1. Sound quality stinks and that is only with the music it will listen to. It won’t connect or even recognize the Apple 11Pro it was trying to connect to, so it never worked to make phone calls even with my Bose earbuds. I’m going back to Apple products. They know what they’re doing.
__________________________
Couldnt find these at walmart so i looked on Amazon but later found them at the dollar store. These are obviously overpriced
__________________________
Poor quality. Would not recommend.
__________________________
Audio hiss and the lightning plug broke within a week
__________________________
Took a bottle to Prague with me but it just did not seem to do much.
__________________________
I didn't even get it in the mail. I got my other order and this was supposed to be in the package, but it wasn't there.
__________________________
I've been using this product with my laundry for a while now and I like it, but I had to return it because it wasn't packaged right and everything was damaged.
__________________________
PINK PART CRACKED AS SOON AS I PUT MY PHONE IN THE CASE
__________________________
Photo sensor to sensitive. Lights turn on and turn off herself.
__________________________
The book is a good quality. However, it is very inaccurate on it’s scientific principles. I have never read such a book before. Nothing in it is accurate.
__________________________
This is the worst mascara I have ever tried, and I've tried them all. I never got the length that was advertised and then when I went to put a second coat on, it basically turned all of my eyelashes into one big lash--all stuck together. I've seen some advertising in the past that was a little misleading, but this should be illegal to lie this bad.
__________________________
Shines dimly. broke on next day! Awful, terrible quality. Price is higher than any other. Do not waste time and money on this!
__________________________
Wasn’t happy how it bent my hats & also left a line on the bill from the plastic
__________________________
I immediately returned it. You use to have it with a lemon scent which was very pleasant.
__________________________
This was not the shoe I ordered. The lacing system was not as depicted in the photo. Instead of eyelets there were nylon straps that broke when I first tightened them.
__________________________
Broken when I opened the box. Very disappointed.
__________________________
My child did not like at all the flavor. Texture is weird
__________________________
Never received item. Given a refund.
__________________________
Worst cable I have had to date for my iphone. It's so stiff if you move it at all while plugged in, it disconnects. I have to carefully plug it in all the way and it doesn't give that really solid click feel, then if disturbed at all it loses connection. I have another Anker Powerline 1 cable and it has been great. Not sure how the II can go backwards. My window to return has closed so I guess I'll contact them directly and see if they will replace with a different cable.
__________________________
I had the bag just over a week and the handle already broke!
__________________________
When you pour the body wash on the bristles it doesn't foam up. No matter how much you rub it to try and get it to foam it doesn't. Don't buy this if you use body wash because you will be unhappy... Requested Return the very same day after I tried to use it.
__________________________
The FIRST time I used this product the zipper broke. It arrived 3 hours ago and I'm already sending it back. I'm very frustrated as I wasted time debating between this product and competitors. Obviously I made the wrong choice.
__________________________
Came in a box with bottled water. Bag was crushed and opened.
__________________________
Yeah it’s great to have a remote for PS Vue but every time you go to use it you have to press either the TV or PS4 button. More irritating than helpful. Such a buzz kill.
__________________________
I never got this when it said I did????
__________________________
These are really low quality.
__________________________
Stops working after 3 weeks of use. Good thing that I have a backup filter. Please replace.
__________________________
Stop using Amazon Delivery Drivers, they are incompetent and continually damage packages
__________________________
Its says theres 100 and i only received 80 😡😡😡
__________________________
Didn't notice a difference.
__________________________
Camera fail to focus after couple of months. Wife loved that phone and love it more than new Nokia, but we can’t figure out how to fix it.
__________________________
This was a super difficult read with no characters that were of value. I found it not up to his usual quality.
__________________________
This pen is garbage just got them they’re already skipping this is the first time writing with them not to mention that they are so ugly they are not full like they are in the picture they have no feathers
__________________________
The idea of this truck was really cool until it arrived with a small crack. My son went to open one side and the plastic broke all the way, which has rendered the truck useless since it is sharp and dangerous. I would not recommend this product.
__________________________
I just got these in the mail. Work for like a minute and than gives me the accessory is not supported by this iPhone. I have the iPhone 7. It’s really wack for a deal of two of them
__________________________
Awful product. I tried different doses (2 to 6 sprays) when I needed a boost in energy. I did not get any positive result, neither mental nor physical. All I got from this product were heart palpitations.
__________________________
Probably was me but they're the wrong size headers came with all hardware so we good
__________________________
It worked for a week. My husband loved it. And then all of the sudden it won't charge or turn on. It just stopped working.
__________________________
I tried these with 2 two different pens. The ink does not flow and the cartridge dries out after a few days.
__________________________
Only lasted 2 months!
__________________________
I can't really write a review as my item does not turn on. I've tried charging with different cords, plugs etc. I apparently missed my return window by 1 day and there's no way for me to contact the seller. I would not recommend!
__________________________
After 5 minutes of supervised play, the motor started making high pitched terrible screeching noises. Don't buy unless you have a tiny, useless little rat of a dog. Wasted $18.00
__________________________
Worst purchase on amazon
__________________________
Did NOT fit the car we so carefully measured for. The description and sizing is all wrong. Buy larger than you actually need. Its thin and rips easily.
__________________________
Didn't work at all. Our brand new Xbox One X did nothing with the Kinect One.
__________________________
I love the idea of this gate and the way it looks but I’ve now had two and they both broke, one broken outta the box and the other broke pretty immediately after setting it up. Super disappointed especially for the cost!!
__________________________
This product was supposed to ship in 2 days with prime. It took 2 weeks, ended up not being delivered on the updated date they said it would be, then because the package was left on a delivery day other than what was expected based on their updated information, it was stolen off the front porch as we weren’t expecting a delivery that day. Amazon refunded and I will buy from a different seller.
__________________________
Knew in 5 seconds it was not for me. However I completely blame the misleading Title. Shame on you for " allowing people to believe it's anything close to the real game.
__________________________
I NEVER GOT THIS ORDER PLEASE SEND ITS TO ME
__________________________
The product fits fine and looks good. turn signal and heated mirror work. Unfortunately, the mirror vibrates on rough roads and rattles going over bumps. Plan to return it for a replacement.
__________________________
Doesn’t work! You can hear the battery moving back and forth and it feels cheaply made, wouldn’t recommend to anyone would actually tell them not to buy from them.
__________________________
Not good. Absorbs heat like memory foam.
__________________________
This is our 4th automatic kwikset lock. Not sure what is going on during manufacturing but they work well for a while then all of a sudden the lock just stops working; beeps for no reason, the keypad doesnt respond when the code is pressed and it randomly goes through a series of locking and unlocking without being triggered. I wish I could return this and get my money back. We replaced the batteries before going on vacation, our pet sitter called us to come home because the lock would not respond when she entered the code. We had to come home from vacation to make sure our dogs were ok! Dangerous and a piece of junk!
__________________________
I am returning. Very flimsy, could not get top to stay on because the design, shelves did not stay in one place. Would not recommend this.
__________________________
Not worth it the data cable had to move it in a certain position to make it work i just returned it back.
__________________________
The product did not work properly, after having it installed the check engine light came back on
__________________________
Repair looks like crap and they will not take returns! Stay away and don't waste your money here.
__________________________
I bought this product and thought it was awesome in the box but when I shot it I discovered it jammed frequently and pinches you at the top unless your very careful and after about 10 ft the pellet curves upward severely. After it fell from a barely 2 ft tall coffee table it broke and would not cock Iv also noticed after reading a lot of reviews that this is frequent
__________________________
I wish I had taken a picture of the set before I sent it back. But just know that the fork tine split off and the knife had splinters on it that snagged the gauzy bag for storage. The reason I purchased this was to see how the bamboo ones differed. One good thing is that the weight of bamboo is quite a bit less than metal utensils. Couldn't comment on "Easy To Clean" since I didn't actually use it - afraid of splinters!
__________________________
I received two of these and both have been defective, leaking butane liquid when attempting to refill butane lighters.
__________________________
I SHOULD HAVE RETURNED THIS PRODUCT BUT THE RETURN WINDOW RAN OUT. The liner comes folded and does not lay flat. I thought that if I left it out, the material would eventually relax and become flat. It has been out a week and it I still all rippled. Why would the manufacturer not ship it in a tube or wrapped around a tube!!!! This liner is useless. What a joke. Do not buy.
__________________________
It's nearly impossible to find a 5 gallon bucket that this seat fits onto. I'd recommend buying the 2 together so that you might get a set that fits.
__________________________
The adhesive is only on the borders, I have to press harder on the screen, it cracked after a couple of days.... not good!
__________________________
Case is nice and feels good. Was not able to complete assembly because the kit I received did not include hardware. Purchased several months ago and just got around to putting it together, so unable to receive refund :(
__________________________
Most were sour and dry. I ended up throwing most of them out. Don’t know if I just got a bad bag but I’m afraid to try again.
__________________________
Cheap, don’t work. Very dim. Not worth the money.
__________________________
Navy color is 40% polyester. Stitching coming loose after a few washes.
__________________________
I used it only twice and when the sidewalk ended, it went out and didn't turn on anymore. I did not buy it. Do not throw your money
__________________________
Did not open the bottle,too late to return to seller.
__________________________
Sadly, really doesn't seem to work worth a darn. Maybe is the particular kind of dust where I am but It just makes patterns in the dust. Doesn't seem to capture it or lift it off.If I can still return it I will.
__________________________
The product is of very poor quality broke just after few uses
__________________________
This is at least the 4th hose I've tried. I had high hopes, but the metal parts are cheap and it leaks from the connector. The "fabric??" of the hose retains water and stays wet for hours or days depending on how hot - or not - the weather is. I do not recommend this product.
__________________________
2 out of three stopped working after two weeks.! Threw them all in the trash. Don't waste your money
__________________________
The bible contains pictures, which depict Christ. The illustrations are well done, but give the bible a cartoon feel. My young reader wanted a more grown up bible. There are many, many sections of pictures which neither of us liked. Also, the pages are not bound well.
__________________________
It didn’t work at all. All the wax got stuck at the top and would never flow.
__________________________
These did not fit my 98 Chevy k1500. There was an overhang at the bottom and would not sit flush. It was a shame as they appeared to be of good quality. I returned them and was out the money for the shipping. Was advertised to fit my model and year, but that was not accurate so be careful. By the way I never write reviews, but I felt I had to on this one since I had to pay shipping on my return for a product that claimed to fit and did not.
__________________________
Worst iPhone charger ever. The charger head broke after used for 5 Times. Terrible quality.
__________________________
When the case is on my phone, my sound gets muffled and the caller can’t hear me at all.
__________________________
A complete and utter piece of garbage. I never damaged, dropped, or neglected this device and by the end of 3 months it is no longer charging. The response time is abysmal when trying to access apps. Then, once accessed, the phone takes it upon itself to kick you OUT of the app. The screen, at times, is completely unresponsive. The memory is virtually gone with just the addition of a few basic apps. Sometimes you get a good product at a good price. Other times, you get exactly what you pay for. AVOID, AVOID, AVOID.
__________________________
I had it less than a week and the c type tip that connects to my S9 got burnt.
__________________________
does not support wireless charging like it was advertised to do so
__________________________
I have returned it. Did not like it.
__________________________
Purchased in June 2019 and no longer works two months later???? The button (for arms to release or hold the phone) is locked and therefore mechanism doesn't work....... We love the features of this make & model, but going to look elsewhere for something more reliable.
__________________________
I never should've ordered this for my front porch steps. It had NO Adhesion and was a BIG disappointment.
__________________________
Order the set with 2 cables . Black housing. Only got 1 cable no housing
__________________________
We've had nothing but problems with it doesn't function and the screen is constantly having problems will not stay on troubleshoot is it and still the screen will not come on
__________________________
If I could give a zero I would. I have emailed this company 3 times that I haven't receive my lunch bag. They told me the post office left a note of an attempted delivery. I've never received a slip. I've called the post office and they dont have my bag. The emails tells me to keep calling the post office. O just want my lunch bag or my money back.
__________________________
This product is to small to even fit on my waste lining! Made in China so I assume a person that is normal in US large must be a very 3x person over there. But it is what it is!
__________________________
relieved itching in ear for a few seconds.
__________________________
It was working fine for the first 3 months after purchased. But after that I need to change battery every month and now it does not dispense any more soap. That is a design flaw where the soap will dry up and block the soap dispense hole.
__________________________
The width and the depth were opposite of what it said, so they did not fit my cabinet.
__________________________
I'm sure its a lovely book.. Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my nephew. Not very please with the looks of it.
__________________________
It was dried out when I opened package. Was very disappointed with this product.
__________________________
My daughter said they shocked her inside her ear.
__________________________
Absolutely worthless! Adhesive does not stick!
__________________________
When it arrived and I sat it down on the table it was very unbalanced and the feet on it was uneven. Scared to use thinking it’s gonna fall over and burn my house down!
__________________________
He’d are just cheap polyester sheets. NOT MICROFIBER! Not super soft. They’re silky soft like cheap polyester is.
__________________________
BINDING FALLS APART: Throw it away!! I cannot imagine why they would bother to produce such a poor quality product for such HARD WORKING professionals!! This book is used every day- almost every hour. It fell apart instantly with use the first week. so sad...
__________________________
Holes all over the dress, terrible!!!
__________________________
Ran entirely too small
__________________________
Glass was broken had to ship it back waiting on the new one to be here tomorrow hopefully not not broken.
__________________________
Shipped wrong tire. Not sure how this can happen when the description is what you’re sending.
__________________________
I wanted to be able to use both sides at the same time Very dissatisfied with the product
__________________________
The cover felt soft enough after washing. I followed directions exactly as stated. It leaked the first night and every night since. I am disappointed. It is a good thing that I used a different cover underneath it just in case.
__________________________
Product was diluted!!! I had used this as a hand soap at a friends house and REALLY liked it. She’d purchased her bottle from homegoods. So I ordered mine on Amazon. I was so totally disappointed and felt a little insulted. The package and scent were as I remembered and liked, but the product was DEFINITELY watered down. Felt like what you’d do to dish soap when you come to the end and you rinse the bottle out to get the last drop. I couldn’t believe it. Maybe try another seller if you like this soap!!
__________________________
The wires did not last long at all. The piece that connects to the phone comes off, you have to have the phone sitting in a certain position for the phone to charge.
__________________________
My cat didn't want to chew it. I wasted my money.
__________________________
Disappointed. They do not work. I invested in a tool. Still not good
